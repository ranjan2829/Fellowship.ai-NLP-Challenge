# Sentiment Analysis of IMDb Reviews

## Introduction

This project aims to analyze the sentiment of IMDb movie reviews using various sentiment analysis techniques. The objective is to evaluate and compare the performance of different sentiment analysis methods, ranging from traditional lexicon-based approaches to advanced deep learning models.

## Methods Used

The following sentiment analysis techniques are implemented and evaluated in this project:

1. **VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)**
2. **TextBlob**
3. **RoBERTa (Robustly optimized BERT approach)**
4. **DistilBERT**
5. **Hugging Face Sentiment Analysis Pipeline**

## Project Outline

1. **Load the Dataset**:
   - Load the IMDb reviews dataset and preprocess it for sentiment analysis.

2. **Implement Sentiment Analysis Techniques**:
   - Apply each of the five sentiment analysis methods to the dataset.

3. **Evaluate Accuracy**:
   - Calculate the accuracy of each method by comparing the predicted sentiments with the actual sentiments in the dataset.

4. **Visualize Results**:
   - Plot the results to visually compare the performance of each sentiment analysis technique.

5. **Comparison of Results**:
   - Provide a comparative analysis of the accuracies of all the methods used.

## Usage
